-*-Text-*-
This is the file INFO;DIR >, which contains the topmost node of the
info hierarchy.  The first time you invoke INFO you start off
looking at that node ( "(INFO;DIR)Top" ).

File: DIR	Node: Top	This is the top of the tree

This is the Directory node of INFO.  The "D" command comes back here.
The directory is a list of all the major topics that INFO knows about.
You can see it, starting ten lines or so below this line.

If you need help in using INFO, "?" will get you a brief refresher
listing all the commands, and "H" will show you a primer.  If this is
your first use of INFO, you should definitely type "H".  To exit INFO
type "Q".

Everyone is encouraged and asked, urged and exhorted, implored and cajoled,
to add documentation to this tree. (Visit Menu item INFO for how).

* Menu: The "Menu" is the list of topics.  Here it is:

* INFO:	(INFO)Top	INFO is this program.  Look here for how to
			add documentation to the tree.
  ^^ Notice that INFO is the topic, while (INFO)Top is the node name.
* EMACS: (EMACS)Top	EMACS is an editor / collection of subsystems.
* Twenex::
* Text Editors::
* Mail Readers::

* Menu:

* EMACS: (EMACS)Top	EMACS is an editor / collection of subsystems.

* TAGS: (TAGS)		TAGS, an EMACS library, remembers the location
			of every tag in one or more files, so you can
			go to any of them very quickly.

* BABYL: (BABYL)Top	Babyl is an EMACS-based mail reader.

* ZBabyl: (ZBabyl)	ZBabyl is an experimental extension to Babyl which
			offers some additional features inspired by ZMail.
			Its mail file format is compatible with Babyl's, so
			it is possible to go back and forth.
			New users are encouraged to use normal Babyl.

Node: Mail Readers, Up: (DIR), Previous: Text Editors, Next: Formatting Systems


There are at least two standard mail readers on OZ, MM and Babyl:

* Menu:

* BABYL: (BABYL)Top	Babyl is an EMACS-based mail reader.
* MM: (DOC:MM.DOC)*	Powerful line-mode mail reader.

* Menu:

* ATSIGN: (ATSIGN)	Generates program or text listings with
			cross references, table of contents, etc.

* R: (RGUIDE)		A general, multi-font, multi-device, multi-system
* RGUIDE: (RGUIDE)	text formatter, with many advanced features such
			as footnotes, table of contents, etc., available.
			Currently the most popular formatter in the LCS/AI
			community.  Runs on ITS, VAX, and UNIX, too.
			
* RMAN: (DOC:R20.MANUAL)*
			The R reference manual.  You probably
			want the R GUIDE, instead.

* TeX:   (PS:<TEX.DOC>TBASE)
* Tbase: (PS:<TEX.DOC>TBASE)
* XTEX:  (PS:<TEX.DOC>TBASE)
		        The TeX formatting system.  Produces much
			higher quality output than R, especially
			when setting mathematics.  Its use is
			described in conjunction with the Tbase
			macro package, which makes basic document
			formatting fairly easy (a la the R
			standard macro package.)  TeX also runs
			on ITS and the VAX.

* ISPELL: (SPELL)
* SPELL: (SPELL)	This is a program to check and correct spelling.
			It understands the syntax of source documents
			for the formatters TJ6, R, PUB, SCRIBE, and TEX.  It is
			available (under the name SPELL) on ITS also.
